Description: The proBatch package facilitates batch effects analysis and correction in 
  high-thoughput experiments. It was developed primarily for mass-spectrometry proteomics (DIA/SWATH), 
  but could also be applicable to most omic data with minor adaptations. The package contains functions 
  for diagnostics (proteome/genome-wide and feature-level), correction (normalization and batch effects 
  correction) and quality control. Non-linear fitting based approaches were also included to deal with 
  complex, mass spectrometry-specific signal drifts.
