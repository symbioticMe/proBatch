Description: The proBatch package facilitates batch effects analysis and correction
    in high-thoughput experiments. Although the package has primarily been developed 
    for mass-spectrometry proteomics (DIA/SWATH), it should also be applicable 
    to most omic data with minor adaptations.
    The package contains functions for diagnostics (proteome/genome-wide and feature-level),
    correction (normalization and batch effects correction) and quality control.
    Diagnostics part of the package features unified color scheme for plotting, 
    that allows to produce publication-quality graphs.
    Correction functions are convenient wrappers for common normalization and 
    batch effects removal approaches such as quantile normalizetion and median centering. 
    Furthermore, the package includes non-linear fitting based approaches to deal 
    with complex, mass spectrometry-specific signal drifts.
    Quality control step, mostly based on correlation analysis, allows to assess whether 
    the correction improved the quality of the data.
    All steps of batch effects analysis and correction are illustrated in the vignette,
    using the subset of real-world large-scale dataset.
