\format{A data frame with 233 rows and 11 variables:
\describe{
  \item{FullRunName}{name of the file with the measurement for each sample, referred to as \code{sample_id_col}}
  \item{MS_batch}{mass-spectrometry batch: 4-level factor of 
  manually annotated batches}
  \item{EarTag}{mouse ID, i.e. ID of the biological object. Only 14 mice have been replicated, one mouse was profiled 7 times.}
  \item{Strain}{mouse strain ID from BXD population set - biological covariate #1, 51 Strain represented}
  \item{Diet}{diet, biological covariate #2 - either \code{HFD} = `High Fat Diet` or \code{CD} = `Chow Diet`}
  \item{Sex}{mice sex - biological covariate #3}
  \item{RunDate}{mass-spectrometry running date. In combination 
  with \code{RunTime} used for running order determination. Vector of class \code{"difftime"} and \code{"hms"}}
  \item{RunTime}{mass-spectrometry running time. In combination 
  with \code{RunDate} used for running order determination.Vector of class \code{"POSIXct"} and \code{"POSIXt"}}
  \item{DateTime}{numeric date and time generated by \code{date_to_sample_order}}
  \item{order}{order of samples generated by sorting DateTime 
  in \code{date_to_sample_order}}

  factor of manually annotated batches}
