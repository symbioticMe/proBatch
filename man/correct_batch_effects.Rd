\title{Batch correction method allows correction of 
continuous signal drift within batch (if required) and adjustment for
discrete difference across batches.}
\usage{
correct_batch_effects(df_long, sample_annotation, continuous_func = NULL,
  discrete_func = c("MedianCentering", "ComBat"),
  batch_col = "MS_batch", feature_id_col = "peptide_group_label",
  sample_id_col = "FullRunName", measure_col = "Intensity",
  sample_order_col = "order", abs_threshold = 5, pct_threshold = 0.2,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_long}{data frame where each row is a single feature in a single
sample. It minimally has a \code{sample_id_col}, a \code{feature_id_col} and a
\code{measure_col}, but usually also an \code{m_score} (in OpenSWATH output result
file). See "example_proteome" for more details (to call the description, use \code{help("example_proteome")})}

\item{sample_annotation}{data frame with: \enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col}
(this can be repeated as row names) \item biological covariates \item
technical covariates (batches etc) }. 
See "example_sample_annotation" for example with the detailed description (to call it, use \code{help("example_sample_annotation")})}

\item{continuous_func}{function to use for the fit (currently 
only \code{loess_regression} available); if order-associated fix is not required, should be `NULL`}

\item{discrete_func}{function to use for adjustment of discrete batch effects (\code{MedianCentering} or \code{ComBat})}

\item{batch_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that should be used for
batch comparison}

\item{feature_id_col}{name of the column with feature/gene/peptide/protein
ID used in the long format representation \code{df_long}. In the wide
formatted representation \code{data_matrix} this corresponds to the row
names.}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in \code{sample_annotation} table, where the
filenames (colnames of the data matrix are found).}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency.}

\item{abs_threshold}{the absolute threshold to filter data for curve fitting}

\item{pct_threshold}{the percentage threshold to filter data for curve fitting}

\item{...}{other parameters, usually of \code{normalize_custom_fit}, and \code{fit_func}}
}
\value{
\code{data_matrix}-size data matrix with batch-effect 
corrected by fit and discrete functions
}
