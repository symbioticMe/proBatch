}
\arguments{
\item{pep_name}{name of the peptide for diagnostic profiling}

\item{df_long}{data frame where each row is a single feature in a single
sample. It minimally has a \code{sample_id_col}, a \code{feature_id_col} and a
\code{measure_col}, but usually also an \code{m_score} (in OpenSWATH output result
file)}

\item{sample_annotation}{data matrix with: \enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col}
(this can be repeated as row names) \item biological covariates \item
technical covariates (batches etc) }}

\item{fit_df}{data frame typically output generated from nonlinear curve 
fitting by \code{normalize_custom_fit}}

\item{fit_value_var}{column denoting intensity values, typically fitted to curve}

\item{order_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that determines sample order. It is
used for certain diagnostics and normalisations.}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in sample_annotation file, where the
filenames (colnames of the data matrix are found)}

\item{batch_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that should be used for
batch comparison}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency}

\item{feature_id_col}{name of the column with feature/gene/peptide/protein
ID used in the long format representation \code{df_long}. In the wide
formatted representation \code{data_matrix} this corresponds to the row
names.}

\item{geom}{for the intensity \code{measure_col} profile}

\item{color_by_batch}{(logical) whether to color points by batch}

\item{color_scheme}{color scheme for \code{ggplot} representation}

\item{facet_by_batch}{(logical) whether to plot each batch in its own facet}

\item{plot_title}{the string indicating the source of the peptides}

\item{color_by_col}{column to color by certain value denoted by \code{color_by_value}}

\item{color_by_value}{value in \code{color_by_col} to color}

\item{theme}{plot theme (default is 'classical'; other options not
implemented)}

\item{vline_color}{color of vertical lines, typically denoting 
different batches}

\item{...}{additional arguments to \code{\link{plot_single_feature}} function}
}
\value{
\code{ggplot}-class plot with minimally two facets (before and after
  non-linear fit) with \code{measure_col} (Intensity) vs \code{order_col}
  (injection order) for selected peptides (specified in \code{pep_name})
}
\description{
Plot Intensity of a few representative peptides for each step of the analysis
including the fitting curve
