\title{Plot per-sample mean or boxplots (showing median and quantiles). In ordered samples,
e.g. consecutive MS runs, order-associated effects are visualised.}
\usage{
plot_sample_mean(data_matrix, sample_annotation = NULL,
  sample_id_col = "FullRunName", batch_col = "MS_batch",
  color_by_batch = FALSE, color_scheme = "brewer",
  order_col = "order", vline_color = "grey", facet_col = NULL,
  plot_title = NULL, theme = "classic", ylimits = NULL)

plot_boxplot(df_long, sample_annotation = NULL,
  sample_id_col = "FullRunName", measure_col = "Intensity",
  batch_col = "MS_batch", color_by_batch = TRUE,
  color_scheme = "brewer", order_col = "order", facet_col = NULL,
  plot_title = NULL, theme = "classic", ylimits = NULL,
  outliers = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{features (in rows) vs samples (in columns) matrix, with
feature IDs in rownames and file/sample names as colnames. 
See "example_proteome_matrix" for more details (to call the description, use \code{help("example_proteome_matrix")})}

\item{sample_annotation}{data frame with: \enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col}
(this can be repeated as row names) \item biological covariates \item
technical covariates (batches etc) }. 
See "example_sample_annotation" for example with the detailed description (to call it, use \code{help("example_sample_annotation")})}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in \code{sample_annotation} table, where the
filenames (colnames of the data matrix are found).}

\item{batch_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that should be used for
batch comparison}

\item{color_by_batch}{(logical) whether to color points and connecting lines 
by batch factor as defined by \code{batch_col}.}

\item{color_scheme}{named vector, names corresponding to unique batch values of 
\code{batch_col} in \code{sample_annotation}. Best created with \link{sample_annotation_to_colors}}

\item{order_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that determines sample order. It is
used for in initial assessment plots (\link{plot_sample_mean_or_boxplot}) and 
feature-level diagnostics (\link{feature_level_diagnostics}). Can be `NULL` 
if sample order is irrelevant (e.g. in genomic experiments). For more details,
order definition/inference, see \link{define_sample_order} and \link{date_to_sample_order}}

\item{vline_color}{color of vertical lines, typically denoting 
different MS batches in ordered runs; should be \code{NULL} for experiments without intrinsic order}

\item{facet_col}{column  in \code{sample_annotation} with a batch factor to separate 
plots into facets; usually 2nd to \code{batch_col}. Most meaningful for multi-instrument 
MS experiments (where each instrument has its own order-associated effects, see \code{order_col}) 
or simultaneous examination of two batch factors (e.g. preparation day and measurement day).
For single-instrument case should be set to `NULL`}

\item{plot_title}{title of the plot (e.g., processing step + representation
level (fragments, transitions, proteins) + purpose (meanplot/corrplot etc))}

\item{theme}{ggplot theme, by default \code{classic}. Can be easily overriden}

\item{ylimits}{range of y-axis to compare two plots side by side, if required.}

\item{df_long}{data frame where each row is a single feature in a single
sample. It minimally has a \code{sample_id_col}, a \code{feature_id_col} and a
\code{measure_col}, but usually also an \code{m_score} (in OpenSWATH output result
file). See "example_proteome" for more details (to call the description, use \code{help("example_proteome")})}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency.}

\item{outliers}{keep (default) or remove the boxplot outliers}
