\title{Plot per-sample mean or boxplot (showing median and quantiles) vs order (if the real
running order available)}
\usage{
plot_sample_mean(data_matrix, sample_annotation = NULL,
  sample_id_col = "FullRunName", order_col = "order",
  batch_col = "MS_batch", facet_col = NULL, color_by_batch = F,
  color_scheme = "brewer", theme = "classic", plot_title = NULL,
  order_per_facet = F, vline_color = "grey", ylimits = NULL)

plot_boxplot(df_long, sample_annotation = NULL,
  sample_id_col = "FullRunName", measure_col = "Intensity",
  order_col = "order", batch_col = "MS_batch", facet_col = NULL,
  color_by_batch = T, color_scheme = "brewer", theme = "classic",
  plot_title = NULL, order_per_facet = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{features (in rows) vs samples (in columns) matrix, with
feature IDs in rownames and file/sample names as colnames. in most
function, it is assumed that this is the log transformed version of the
original data}

\item{sample_annotation}{data matrix with 1) `sample_id_col` (this can be
repeated as row names) 2) biological and 3) technical covariates (batches
etc)}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in sample_annotation file, where the
filenames (colnames of the data matrix are found)}

\item{order_col}{column where running order is specified.}

\item{batch_col}{column in `sample_annotation` that should be used for
batch comparison}

\item{facet_col}{recommended if more than one batch covariate is present.
Faceting is most suited to examine instruments separately}

\item{color_by_batch}{should the each batch be represented with its own
color?}

\item{color_scheme}{named vector, names corresponding to unique batch values
as specified in `sample_annotation`}

\item{theme}{ggplot theme, by default `classic`. Can be easily overriden (see
examples)}

\item{plot_title}{Title of the plot (usually, processing step + representation
level (fragments, transitions, proteins))}

\item{order_per_facet}{if order is defined ignoring facets (usually
instrument), re-define order per-batch}

\item{df_long}{data frame where each row is a single feature in a single
sample, thus it has minimally, `sample_id_col`, `feature_id_col` and
`measure_col`, but usually also `m_score` (in OpenSWATH output result
file)}

\item{measure_col}{if `df_long` is among the parameters, it is the column
with expression/abundance/intensity, otherwise, it is used internally for
consistency}
