\title{Batch correction method allows correction of continuous sigal drift within batch and 
discrete difference across batches.}
\usage{
correct_batch_effects(data_matrix, sample_annotation,
  fitFunc = "loess_regression", discreteFunc = "MedianCentering",
  batch_col = "MS_batch", feature_id_col = "peptide_group_label",

}
\arguments{
\item{discreteFunc}{function to use for discrete batch correction (`MedianCentering` or `ComBat`)}

\item{...}{other parameters, usually of `normalize_custom_fit`, and `fit_func`}

\item{fitFunct}{function to use for the fit (currently only `loess_regression` available)}
}
\value{
`data_matrix`-size data matrix with batch-effect corrected by fit and discrete functions
}
