\usage{
matrix_to_long(data_matrix, sample_annotation = NULL,
  feature_id_col = "peptide_group_label", measure_col = "Intensity",
  sample_id_col = "FullRunName", step = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{features (in rows) vs samples (in columns) matrix, with
feature IDs in rownames and file/sample names as colnames. Usually the log
transformed version of the original data}

\item{sample_annotation}{data matrix with: \enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col}
(this can be repeated as row names) \item biological covariates \item
technical covariates (batches etc) }}

\item{feature_id_col}{name of the column with feature/gene/peptide/protein
ID used in the long format representation \code{df_long}. In the wide
formatted representation \code{data_matrix} this corresponds to the row
names.}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in sample_annotation file, where the
filenames (colnames of the data matrix are found)}

\item{step}{normalization step (e.g. \code{Raw} or \code{Quantile_normalized} or
\code{qNorm_ComBat}). Useful if consecutive steps are compared in plots. Note
that in plots these are usually ordered alphabetically, so it's worth
naming with numbers, e.g. \code{1_raw}, \code{2_quantile}}
}
\value{
\code{df_long} (\link{proBatch}) like data frame
