\usage{
fit_nonlinear(df_feature_batch, batch_size = NULL,
  measure_col = "Intensity", order_col = "order", feature_id = NULL,
  batch_id = NULL, fit_func = "loess_regression",
  optimize_span = FALSE, no_fit_imputed = FALSE,
  qual_col = "m_score", qual_value = 2, abs_threshold = 5,
  pct_threshold = 0.2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_feature_batch}{data frame containing response variable e.g. 
samples in order and explanatory 
  variable e.g. measurement for a specific feature (peptide) in a specific batch}

\item{batch_size}{the total number of samples in the batch to 
compute for percentage threshold}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency.}

\item{order_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that determines sample order. It is
used for in initial assessment plots (\link{plot_sample_mean_or_boxplot}) and 
feature-level diagnostics (\link{feature_level_diagnostics}). Can be `NULL` 
if sample order is irrelevant (e.g. in genomic experiments). For more details,
order definition/inference, see \link{define_sample_order} and \link{date_to_sample_order}}

\item{feature_id}{the name of the feature, required for warnings}

\item{batch_id}{the name of the batch, required for warnings}

\item{fit_func}{function to use for the fit, e.g. \code{loess_regression}}

\item{optimize_span}{logical, whether to specify span or optimize it 
(specific entirely for LOESS regression)}

\item{no_fit_imputed}{(logical) whether to fit requanted values}

\item{qual_col}{column to color point by certain value denoted 
by \code{color_by_qual_value}. Design with inferred/requant values in openSWATH output data, 
which means argument value has to be set to \code{m_score}.}

\item{abs_threshold}{the absolute threshold to filter 
data for curve fitting}

\item{pct_threshold}{the percentage threshold to filter 
data for curve fitting}

\item{...}{additional paramters to be passed to the fitting function}
}
\value{
vector of fitted response values
}
