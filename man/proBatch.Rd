\title{proBatch: A package for diagnostics and correction of batch effects,
primarily in proteomics}
\arguments{
\item{df_long}{data frame where each row is a single feature in a single
sample. It minimally has a \code{sample_id_col}, a \code{feature_id_col} and a
\code{measure_col}, but usually also an \code{m_score} (in OpenSWATH output result
file)}

\item{data_matrix}{features (in rows) vs samples (in columns) matrix, with
feature IDs in rownames and file/sample names as colnames. Usually the log
transformed version of the original data}

\item{sample_annotation}{data frame with: \enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col}
(this can be repeated as row names) \item biological covariates \item
technical covariates (batches etc) }}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in \code{sample_annotation} table, where the
filenames (colnames of the data matrix are found).}

\item{measure_col}{if \code{df_long} is among the parameters, it is the
column with expression/abundance/intensity; otherwise, it is used
internally for consistency.}

\item{feature_id_col}{name of the column with feature/gene/peptide/protein
ID used in the long format representation \code{df_long}. In the wide
formatted representation \code{data_matrix} this corresponds to the row
names.}

\item{batch_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that should be used for
batch comparison}

\item{order_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that determines sample order. It is
used for in initial assessment plots (\link{plot_sample_mean_or_boxplot}) and 
feature-level diagnostics (\link{feature_level_diagnostics}). Can be `NULL` 
if sample order is irrelevant (e.g. in genomic experiments). For more details,
order definition/inference, see \link{define_sample_order} and \link{date_to_sample_order}}

\item{facet_col}{column  in \code{sample_annotation} with a batch factor to separate 
plots into facets; usually 2nd to \code{batch_col}. Most meaningful for multi-instrument 
MS experiments (where each instrument has its own order-associated effects, see \code{order_col}) 
or simultaneous examination of two batch factors (e.g. preparation day and measurement day).}

\item{color_by_batch}{(logical) whether to color points and connecting lines 
by batch factor as defined by \code{batch_col}.}

\item{qual_col}{column to color point by certain value denoted 
by \code{color_by_qual_value}. Design with inferred/requant values in openSWATH output data, 
which means argument value has to be set to \code{m_score}.}

\item{color_by_qual_value}{value in \code{qual_col} to color. For OpenSWATH data,
this argument value has to be set to \code{2} (this is an \code{m_score} value for requants).}

\item{plot_title}{title of the plot (usually, processing step + representation
level (fragments, transitions, proteins))}

\item{theme}{ggplot theme, by default \code{classic}. Can be easily overriden}
}
\description{
The proBatch package contains functions for analyzing and correcting batch effects 
and other unwanted technical variation from high-thoughput experiments. Although 
the package has primarily been developed for mass spectrometry proteomics (DIA/SWATH),
it should also be applicable to most omic data with minor adaptations.
It addresses the following needs: \itemize{ \item prepare the data for analysis
\item Visualize batch effects in sample-wide and feature-level;
\item Normalize and correct for batch effects.
