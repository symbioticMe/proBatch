\usage{
define_sample_order(order_col, sample_annotation, facet_col, batch_col,
  df_long, sample_id_col, color_by_batch)
}
\arguments{
\item{order_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that determines sample order. It is
used for in initial assessment plots (\link{plot_sample_mean_or_boxplot}) and 
feature-level diagnostics (\link{feature_level_diagnostics}). Can be `NULL` 
if sample order is irrelevant (e.g. in genomic experiments). For more details,
order definition/inference, see \link{define_sample_order} and \link{date_to_sample_order}}

\item{sample_annotation}{data frame with: \enumerate{ \item \code{sample_id_col}
(this can be repeated as row names) \item biological covariates \item
technical covariates (batches etc) }. 
See "example_sample_annotation" for example with the detailed description (to call it, use \code{help("example_sample_annotation")})}

\item{facet_col}{column  in \code{sample_annotation} with a batch factor to separate 
plots into facets; usually 2nd to \code{batch_col}. Most meaningful for multi-instrument 
MS experiments (where each instrument has its own order-associated effects, see \code{order_col}) 
or simultaneous examination of two batch factors (e.g. preparation day and measurement day).
For single-instrument case should be set to `NULL`}

\item{batch_col}{column in \code{sample_annotation} that should be used for
batch comparison}

\item{df_long}{data frame where each row is a single feature in a single
sample. It minimally has a \code{sample_id_col}, a \code{feature_id_col} and a
\code{measure_col}, but usually also an \code{m_score} (in OpenSWATH output result
file). See "example_proteome" for more details (to call the description, use \code{help("example_proteome")})}

\item{sample_id_col}{name of the column in \code{sample_annotation} table, where the
filenames (colnames of the data matrix are found).}

\item{color_by_batch}{(logical) whether to color points and connecting lines 
by batch factor as defined by \code{batch_col}.}
}
\value{
list of two items: \code{order_col} new name and new \code{df_long}
}
